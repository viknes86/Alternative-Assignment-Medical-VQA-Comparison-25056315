## 🚀 How to Run
The notebooks are designed to run in **Google Colab Pro** (A100 GPU recommended for LLaVA).

**Note:** The training parameters in `LLaVA_MED_model.ipynb` (specifically `per_device_train_batch_size=8`) are optimized for High-RAM GPUs (A100/L4). If running on a smaller GPU (like a T4), please reduce the batch size to 1 or 2 to avoid Out-of-Memory errors.
